Okay, I need to create a README for the project '27. FP ATM Machine IoT'. Let me start with the title, keeping it under 50 characters. Maybe "IoT ATM with Fingerprint Auth & Cash Dispensing" ‚Äì that's concise and descriptive.

The description should explain what the project does. It uses C/C++/Arduino code, integrates fingerprint authentication, connects to WiFi for transactions, and controls a stepper motor for cash dispensing. Need to mention the key components: fingerprint sensor, keypad, LCD, stepper motor, servo, and WiFi module.

Exclude contribution and license info as per the user's request. The pinmap is important. Look at the code snippets to extract the pin assignments. The keypad uses rows 36, 39, 34, 35 and columns 32, 33, 25, 26. Buzzer on 19, stepper pins 13, 12, 14, 27, servo on 4. The LCD is I2C, so likely SDA and SCL, but the code doesn't specify those pins, maybe using default I2C pins. The fingerprint sensor is on Serial2, which on ESP32 might be GPIO 16 and 17. But since the user didn't mention, maybe omit unless specified. Wait, the code includes Adafruit_Fingerprint finger = Adafruit_Fingerprint(&Serial2); so for ESP32, Serial2 uses pins 16 (RX) and 17 (TX), but that's hardware-specific. Since the user wants the pinmap included, list the ones defined in the code.

Include a note about diagrams possibly being inaccurate. The user provided some PDF files but didn't list their names, so maybe just a general note.

Structure the README with sections: Title, Description, Features, Pin Mapping, Usage, Dependencies, Notes. For dependencies, list the libraries used from the code: WiFi, Keypad, Stepper, LiquidCrystal_I2C, Adafruit_Fingerprint, HTTPClient. Maybe include Library Manager links if possible, like the Adafruit fingerprint library.

Usage steps could be initial setup: connect to WiFi, enroll fingerprints via keypad, transactions. Mention the 'D' key for adding fingerprints. Also note the server interaction for balance checks and transactions.

Make sure not to include any markdown formatting beyond what's specified. Avoid emojis unless specified, which they weren't.

Check for anything else: components list? Maybe mention the hardware parts used, like ESP32, fingerprint sensor, keypad, etc., but the user didn't specify to list components. Focus on the code and pinmap.

Ensure clarity and correct pin assignments. Double-check the code's setup function and global variables for pin numbers. Yes, the code has:

- rowPins[ROWS] = {36, 39, 34, 35};
- colPins[COLS] = {32, 33, 25, 26};
- buzzerPin = 19;
- stepper pins 13, 12, 14, 27;
- servoPin = 4;
LCD uses I2C address 0x27.

In the pin mapping section, list each component and their pins. Formatting as a table would be helpful, but since the user didn't specify, maybe use a list.

Note: Since the user mentioned if possible to include pinmap, but may not need a diagram. Just list the pins used for each component.

So, for the Pin Mapping section:

- Keypad:
  - Rows: GPIO 36, 39, 34, 35
  - Columns: GPIO 32, 33, 25, 26
- Buzzer: GPIO 19
- Stepper Motor: Pins 13 (IN1), 12 (IN2), 14 (IN3), 27 (IN4)
- Servo Motor: GPIO 4
- LCD I2C Address: 0x27 (using default I2C pins for the microcontroller)
- Fingerprint Sensor: Connected via Serial2 (UART) ‚Äì depends on the board, but maybe note the specific pins if known. For ESP32, Serial2 uses RX2 (GPIO16) and TX2 (GPIO17). Include that? The code uses &Serial2, so it's implied, so maybe mention that the fingerprint sensor is connected to UART2 pins (16 & 17 for ESP32). Wait, but the user's code doesn't specify the Serial2 pins. Since ESP32 can remap UART pins, but the user didn't set them, so likely using default. So include that note.

Putting it all together, structure the README as instructed, avoiding unnecessary sections. Make sure the note about diagrams is included. The user listed some PDFs but didn't provide names, so just a generic note.
# IoT ATM with Fingerprint Auth & Cash Dispensing

## Description  
A secure IoT-based ATM system utilizing fingerprint authentication (FPM10A), a 4x4 keypad, and WiFi connectivity for real-time balance checks and cash transactions. Integrates a 20x4 LCD, servo-controlled cash gate, and stepper motor for dispensing notes. Built with Arduino/C++ on ESP32, enabling remote database syncing via HTTP requests.

## Features  
- üîí Fingerprint-based user authentication  
- üíµ Stepper motor-driven cash dispensing (100 notes max)  
- üì∂ WiFi connectivity for balance updates (API integration)  
- üéöÔ∏è Keypad input for transaction controls  
- üìü 20x4 I2C LCD for system feedback  
- üîä Audio alerts via buzzer

*Note: Pin assignments may vary depending on microcontroller model. Verify connections against your board's spec sheet.*

## Usage  
1. **Initial Setup**:  
   - Connect to WiFi via hardcoded SSID/PWD  
   - LCD guides through fingerprint enrollment (press 'D' + ID entry)  

2. **Transaction Flow**:  
   - Scan registered fingerprint ‚Üí Enter amount ‚Üí Automatic:  
     - Balance validation via cloud API  
     - Cash dispensing (notes counted on LCD)  
     - Servo-controlled gate actuation  

3. **Error Handling**:  
   - Invalid amounts ‚Üí Buzzer alerts + LCD warnings  
   - Server failures ‚Üí Local error messages  

## Dependencies  
- [Adafruit Fingerprint Sensor Library](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-Fingerprint-Sensor-Library)  
- `Keypad`, `Stepper`, `LiquidCrystal_I2C` (Arduino Library Manager)
